**Overview**

This is my Master's project.

1. Predict stress at which crack starts to occur in a material having different no of pores using Deep ConvNet 
2. Data points are converted into quantized image having pixel values using OpenCV 
3. Accuracy will be determined by performing simulation on material at predicted value

**Code is under progress. Will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned :)**

**Thanks!**
